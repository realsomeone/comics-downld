# Comics Downloader
This python script downloads comics from [getcomics](https://getcomics.com). All it needs is the most recent url and last issue downloaded, automatically finds the issues and downloads them onto the local "comics/" folder.

Right now, only works on MacOS/Linux, only needs to change the `mkdir` command to be compatible on Windows.
